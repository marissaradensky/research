Hi! I'm a second-year computer science PhD student at the University of Washington advised by [Dan Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld) and [Zoran Popović](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/). My research interests are in human-AI interaction and explainable AI. More specifically, I am interested in how methods of transparency can be used to help users of intelligent systems understand when and when not to trust those systems.
